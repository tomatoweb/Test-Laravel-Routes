## Test Laravel Routing

This repository is a test: fill in `routes/web.php` and `routes/api.php`.

Example:

```
// Task 2: point the GET URL "/user/[name]" to the UserController method "show"
// It doesn't use Route Model Binding, it expects $name as a parameter
// Put one code line here below
```

To test if all the routes work correctly, there are PHPUnit tests in `tests/Feature/RoutesTest.php` file.
